"""Canonical subject-position and subject-type handling.

Single source of truth for the two conversion paths that need it:

* ``brkraw_legacy.lib.orient``            -- legacy ``BrukerLoader`` / ``tonii`` CLI
* ``brkraw_legacy.api.analyzer.affine``   -- ``app.tonifti`` API

These used to carry independent copies of the table below, which is how they
drifted apart (the legacy copy gave ``Foot_Left``/``Foot_Right`` the *head-first*
rotation).  Keep the table here only.

#: ``Human`` is the ParaVision 5 spelling of the biped type. Accepted so an

#:
#: Supine/Prone/Left/Right differ by a roll about the bore (head-foot) axis.
#: Feet-first entry is the head-first rotation composed with a 180 degree flip
#: about the table-normal axis, i.e. ``Foot_X == Ry(pi) @ Head_X`` -- which is
#: why every ``Foot_*``/``Tail_*`` entry carries ``rad_y=pi``.  Angles are
#: consumed by ``apply_rotate``/``rotate_affine``, which compose as Rz @ Ry @ Rx
#: in the fixed frame.

    An absent type selects the rodent correction. That looks wrong next to the
    PV6 manual (S1.3.6.2 says the Primate system "is also used for subject
    specimen Unknown"), but the manual is describing ParaVision's own display
    convention, not what a converter should do with PV5 data. Do not "fix" it
    to biped without re-running the validation below.

    ``VisuSubjectType`` exists only from PV6 onwards. ParaVision 5.1 cannot
    express a subject type at all -- it writes ``SUBJECT_type=Human`` for every
    study regardless of the actual specimen -- so on PV5 the type is genuinely
    unknown, and preclinical PV5 data is overwhelmingly rodent.

    Verified against ``testdata/new-orientation/``, where the same mouse
    phantom was scanned head-first prone on both a PV5.1 and a PV6.0.1 system
    (PV5 declares ``Human``, PV6 declares ``Quadruped``). Resampling the PV5
    volumes into the PV6 reference grid:

        rodent axes (absent type -> quadruped)   NCC +0.90 .. +0.95
        primate axes (absent type -> biped)      NCC +0.22

    across four matched 3D FLASH pairs. Honouring the ``Human`` label puts PV5
    rodent data in the wrong frame, so the type must not be taken from the
    study-level ``SUBJECT_type`` either.

    Args:
        subj_type (str or None): raw or normalized subject type. None means
            unknown, which is treated as non-biped.
